            <p>Several years ago, I had the idea to use a microcontroller to monitor and control the environment in an enclosure for a pet lizard. Having received a microcontroller starter kit as a gift, I wanted to test my circuit and programming skills by building a "device" to monitor environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and brightness with some of the components found in the kit. </p>
            <p>The initial goal of this project was to put together the DHT11 sensor to measure local temperature and humidity, the light dependent resistor (LDR) to measure "brightness", and the liquid crystal display (LCD) that came with the kit along with some RGB LEDs that I had previously purchased when I built the RGB LED flashlight. My concept was to display the measured values on the LCD for a user while also indicating the status of each parameter with an LED. The rationale behind this was that a user should not feel the need to constantly monitor the LCD, and can instead simply observe the status of the LEDs from a distance. </p>
